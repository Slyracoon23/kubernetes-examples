Introduction
************

This document describes Wireshark® features that are useful when debugging 
*RTI® Connext® DDS* systems.

Wireshark® is a network-packet analyzer that supports many network protocols, 
including Real-Time Publish-Subscribe (RTPS), the wire protocol used 
by *RTI Connext DDS*.

Wireshark can be used to capture and analyze RTPS packets from *Connext DDS* 
applications. It supports RTPS 2.1 (and lower) and is specifically tailored to 
make RTPS packet analysis easier by including:

  * A set of predefined filters to quickly select different groups of packets 
    from the RTPS protocol.

  * Coloring rules that highlight important RTPS packets. Packets not strictly 
    related to *Connext DDS* traffic are grayed out.
  
  * Support for dissecting RTI TCP messages. This includes RTI TCP Control 
    messages as well as RTPS over RTI TCP.

Network packet and traffic analyzers are used during application development and 
distributed system configuration to monitor packets sent over the network. You 
can use filters to capture specific types of packets, then analyze the captured 
packets.

This document will help you use Wireshark to analyze RTPS packets. This analysis 
will give you information on two levels:

  * A high-level look at the RTPS submessages that are flowing between your *Connext DDS* applications.

  * A detailed look at the contents of individual packets.

Wireshark’s main window makes it easy to see both views.


Available Documentation
-----------------------
* RTI Connext DDS Core Libraries User’s Manual: 
  Provides details on the *Connext DDS* API and describes how RTPS packets 
  are used by *Connext DDS* applications. In particular, you should review the 
  Discovery chapter. 
  
  Open 
  **<NDDSHOME>/doc/manuals/connext_dds/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_UsersManual.pdf**,

How to Get Support
------------------
Technical support for Wireshark is provided by RTI; send email to support@rti.com.

Wireshark is an open source product. For information about Wireshark support, 
please visit https://www.wireshark.org/.


Installing Wireshark
--------------------
Several versions of Wireshark are available for download.

  * Stable version: https://www.wireshark.org

  * Development version: https://www.wireshark.org/download/automated

Improvements and fixes included by the developers are available in 
the development version; however it might be safer to use the Stable 
Release (sometimes features like the I/O graph are not working in the 
development version at a given point in time).

If you want to use the user data dissection feature, it may not be 
in the Stable Release, see the note in  
:ref:`section-UserDataDissection` (:numref:`section-UserDataDissection`).

Running Wireshark from RTI Launcher
-----------------------------------

Once installed, *Wireshark* is integrated with *RTI Launcher* 
and you can start it from the **Tools** tab.
